        <p>
          My name is <span font-500>Oumar Barry</span>.
          I'm a passionate problem solver who enjoys exploring new technologies and taking on new challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          My life revolves around three things that keep me fired up: coding, music, and manga/anime. <br>

          Coding, for me, is not just a skill, but an art form - a way of expressing creativity through lines of code. <br>

          When I'm not coding or exploring Github, you can find me enjoying music, usually French rap, or immersing myself in the captivating worlds of manga/anime.
          I love action-packed anime like Attack on Titan, Naruto and  My Hero Academia, but I also particularly enjoy heart-warming slice-of-life stories like Barakamon and Silver Spoon.
